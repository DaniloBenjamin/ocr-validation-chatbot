# ocr-validation-chatbot
This project aims to extract relevant information from CNH (Brazilian driverâ€™s licenses) using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) techniques, store this data incrementally in an Excel spreadsheet, validate CPF entries with an existing dataset, and provide chatbot-based interaction for querying the stored data.
